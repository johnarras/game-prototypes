======== Overview

The Mighty Wizard's Tale is a game inspired by "blobber" dungeon crawlers
like The Bard's Tale, Might and Magic and Wizardry from decades ago. 
These games have a party of characters that move around the world
in first person mode on a grid.

I recently played some of the games and wanted to have different 
combat mechanics and I also wanted to try to add Roguelike/
Roguelite mechanics with permadeath if the party wipes,
while keeping upgrade points across runs, while creating
a new procedural world each time.

Combat is in the style of The Bard's Tale where players enter
a square and groups of monsters pop into existence at
different ranges and the party chooses their actions and then
combat for all units resolves in sequence.

Stat scaling is in the style of Might and Magic 4-5 where stats
provide bonuses (like strength increases melee damage), but the
bonuses are not linear and slow down.

======== Role listall

The game has Classes that have various attributes and abiltiies, along with
Races that are all Roles. A player picks a Race and a Class at the start, 
and with upgrades players can add extra Classes (that require more
exp and gold to level up).

The classes have a bunch of skills, and scale at different speeds in
different aspects of the game.

======== RoleScalingType listall

The core scaling mechanic in this game is taken from these older games
with mechanics like: "Warriors get an extra attack every 4 levels."
In those games, spells generally had fixed damage/healing values,
or they scaled with the level of the caster. We apply this to
all abilties, so a Mage casting Fireball might get 4.3 "hits"
based on their level and class, which gives them 4 + a chance
for a 5th attack. Skills are learned when the player's scaling
tier reaches the tier fo the spell.

======== CrawlerSpell listall

Because spells scale with the character's level, they should never become
obsolete, so your spellbooks should be smaller, but filled with
better spells. Role scaling will mean the same spell will
hit differently depending on what character is using it.

Single target attacks chain from one unit to the next if initial
hits kill the first units. Larger groups will require spells that
hit all units in a group or on the battlefield.

======== ElementType listall

There are several element types in the game, and monsters can be 
resistant to, or vulnerable to certain elements.

Monsters that are resistant to elements take less damage and
are harder to crit, while monsters that are vulnerable to
a certain element will take more damage from it, and have
a larger chance to be crit.


======== StatType listall

Stats determine how hard skills hit, and how well you defend against them.

======== UnitType listall

There are many monsters in the game with varied skills and attributes. 
They get access to skills as they level up.

======== CrawlerSpell listall

These are all of the abilities that you can learn depending on your class.

======== PartyUpgrade listall

As you explore the world and level up, you will gain upgrade points that
let you upgrade various attributes of your party.

You gain upgrade points the first time any party member reaches the
highest level during the entire game or during this run.

The party also receives upgrade points when they fully explore a
dungeon. If the party fully explores a dungeon at a certain level,
players get upgrade point credit for having explored all dungeons
of a lower level, so you don't have to fully explore all dungeons.

======== MemberUpgrade listall

Each party member also gets upgrade points to spend to allow them
to specialize to become better at whatever parts of their
classes they want to emphasize.


======== Inventory

You may carry as much inventory as you want, but if the party has more than
5 items per party member (can be upgraded), the players will
take longer to move, thus making time pass faster.


======== Time

Moving, fighting and performing other activities take time.
When the party leaves the guild hall, the game advances
to the next day.

Each day, monsters get a bit stronger, so use your time
judiciously.
