======== Overview

The Mighty Wizard's Tale is a game inspired by "blobber" dungeon crawlers
like The Bard's Tale, Might and Magic and Wizardry from decades ago. 
These games have a party of characters that move around the world
in first person mode on a grid.

I recently played some of the games and wanted to have different 
combat mechanics and I also wanted to try to add Roguelike/
Roguelite mechanics with permadeath if the party wipes,
while keeping upgrade points across runs, while creating
a new procedural world each time.

Combat is in the style of The Bard's Tale where players enter
a square and groups of monsters pop into existence at
different ranges and the party chooses their actions and then
combat for all units resolves in sequence.

Stat scaling is in the style of Might and Magic 4-5 where stats
provide bonuses (like strength increases melee damage), but the
bonuses are not linear and slow down.

======== Role listall

The game has Classes that have various attributes and abiltiies, along with
Races that are all Roles. A player picks a Race and a Class at the start, 
and with upgrades players can add extra Classes (that require more
exp and gold to level up).

The classes have a bunch of skills, and scale at different speeds in
different aspects of the game.

======== RoleScalingType listall

The core scaling mechanic in this game is taken from these older games
with mechanics like: "Warriors get an extra attack every 4 levels."
In those games, spells generally had fixed damage/healing values,
or they scaled with the level of the caster. We apply this to
all abilties, so a Mage casting Fireball might get 4.3 "hits"
based on their level and class, which gives them 4 + a chance
for a 5th attack. Skills are learned when the player's scaling
tier reaches the tier fo the spell.

======== CrawlerSpell listall

Because spells scale with the character's level, they should never become
obsolete, so your spellbooks should be smaller, but filled with
better spells. Role scaling will mean the same spell will
hit differently depending on what character is using it.

Single target attacks chain from one unit to the next if initial
hits kill the first units. Larger groups will require spells that
hit all units in a group or on the battlefield.

======== ElementType listall

There are several element types in the game, and monsters can be 
resistant to, or vulnerable to certain elements.

Monsters that are resistant to elements take less damage and
are harder to crit, while monsters that are vulnerable to
a certain element will take more damage from it, and have
a larger chance to be crit.


======== StatType listall

Stats determine how hard skills hit, and how well you defend against them.

======== UnitType listall

There are many monsters in the game with varied skills and attributes. 
They get access to skills as they level up.

======== CrawlerSpell listall

These are all of the abilities that you can learn depending on your class.

======== PartyUpgrade listall

As you explore the world and level up, you will gain upgrade points that
let you upgrade various attributes of your party.

You gain upgrade points the first time any party member reaches the
highest level during the entire game or during this run.

The party also receives upgrade points when they fully explore a
dungeon. If the party fully explores a dungeon at a certain level,
players get upgrade point credit for having explored all dungeons
of a lower level, so you don't have to fully explore all dungeons.

======== MemberUpgrade listall

Each party member also gets upgrade points to spend to allow them
to specialize to become better at whatever parts of their
classes they want to emphasize.

======== Experience

The party gains experience when they kill monsters and complete quests.
Monster exp is lowered when the party's highest level member is higher
than the monster level.

Currently, if the party's highest level member is more than 5 points above 
the monster levels, players lose 15% exp and gold and loot per extra level
until this penalty reaches only getting 10% exp, gold and items.

======== Inventory

You may carry as much inventory as you want, but if the party has more than
5 items per party member (can be upgraded), the players will
take longer to move, thus making time pass faster.

======== Equipment

The equipment is divided into 4 armor types (and implicitly weapons are
divided this way, as well) based on the 4 main attack stats:

	- Cloth gives Intellect (for offensive spell casting)

	- Wood gives Devotion (for healing/curing)

	- Leather gives Agility (for ranged combat)

	- Metal gives Strength (for melee combat)

Equipment also has tiers similar to the Might and Magic series with
more and more impressive material names as the players level up. This
translates into better stats. However, unlike MM, there are no "bad"
tiers worse than no prefix/tier at all.

Combats can award up to 2 items. Each monster has a chance to drop an item
and if the party gets more than 2 items in a combat, the loot will randomly
be reduced to 2 items, but those items will get better stats and get a chance
to get some extra special bonuses:

======== ItemBonuses

These bonuses can be awarded when players would receive more than 2 items
from combat. They only receive 2 items, but those items get better stats
and potentitally some bonuses. These bonuses include:


	The ability to cast spells 
		- Once between combat starts, can upgrade this with party upgrades
		- Using items works when rooms have Silence.
		- The combat power scaling is based on the player's largest
			combat bonus from the various role scalings. Meaning a
			fighter with high strength using a Fireball item would
			get bonus damage to each tick based on their strength bonus.
			This "attunement" means items can be picked up by anyone
			and used effectively rather than requiring everyone to
			get +intellect gear to make the most use of items.
	
	Immunity to debuff types 
		- For the whole party
	
	Ignore Monster element resistances
		- For the whole party
	Ignore map cell mechanics like spinners or antimagic
	
	Ignore riddles and quest item unlocks.

These bonuses are rare, and there are loot tables within loot
tables to determine what bonus you will get, so casting
simple spells like single target attacks are the most common.

======== Time

Moving, fighting and performing other activities take time.
When the party leaves the guild hall, the game advances
to the next day.

Each day, monsters get a bit stronger, so use your time
judiciously.

If you have too many items in your inventory, then it takes you
longer to move each cell in the map, but you can look at a
character sheet and drag items into the "Drop Item" icon
to drop items anywhere in the world, or you can go to a town
and sell the items.
